# San Francisco Crime Analysis Practice Project

## Overview
Welcome to the San Francisco Crime Analysis Practice Project! This repository serves as a sandbox for honing my skills in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) through the analysis of crime data in San Francisco. The project is intended for practice and skill improvement purposes, and it provides an opportunity to explore various AI and ML techniques in a real-world context.
The primary objective of this project is to analyze crime data from San Francisco to uncover insights, trends, and patterns that can inform decision-making processes related to public safety and crime prevention strategies. By understanding the dynamics of crime in the city, I aim to provide actionable insights to stakeholders, including law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and community organizations.

## Methodology
The methodology for this practice project follows a typical data analysis workflow, including:
- **Data Collection:** I collected the crime data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sf-crime/data) covering a specific time period
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing the raw data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct any inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting exploratory data analysis to gain initial insights into the distribution, frequency, and patterns of different types of crimes.
- **Feature Engineering:** Engineering new features and transforming variables to prepare the data for further analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applying statistical techniques to identify correlations, trends, and anomalies within the dataset.
- **Visualization:** Creating visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to communicate findings effectively.
- **Modeling:** Building and evaluating AI and ML models to predict crime occurrences or classify crime types.

## Current Status
As of now , the project is still in progress. I have completed the initial stages of data collection, cleaning, and exploratory analysis. Feature engineering and more in-depth statistical analysis are currently underway. Contributions, feedback, and collaborations are welcome as we continue to refine our analysis and uncover insights into crime patterns in San Francisco.

## Next Steps
- Complete feature engineering and finalize data preprocessing.
- Conduct more in-depth statistical analysis to identify correlations and trends.
- Explore predictive modeling techniques to forecast future crime trends.
- Collaborate with stakeholders to validate findings and gather additional insights.
